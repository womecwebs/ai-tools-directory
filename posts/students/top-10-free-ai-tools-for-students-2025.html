              What are the best AI tools for students in 2025?
            </h3>
            <p>
              The top AI tools for students in 2025 include ChatGPT, Grammarly,
              Notion AI, and Wolfram Alpha. These tools help with writing,
              research, organization, and complex problem-solving — making them

              Is it safe and ethical to use AI tools like ChatGPT for
              schoolwork?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Yes, AI tools can be safe and ethical when used properly. Students
              should use them to generate ideas, check grammar, explain complex
              topics, and enhance productivity — not to plagiarize or submit
              AI-generated work as their own.

              Can I get in trouble for using AI tools in school?
            </h3>
            <p>
              It depends on your school's academic integrity policy. Most
              institutions allow AI for support, but directly copying answers or
              submitting unedited AI content can lead to penalties. Always
              disclose AI use if required.
